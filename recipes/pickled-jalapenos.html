    <h2>Easy Homemade Pickled Jalapenos</h2>

    <p>No refrigerator is complete without a deliciously crunchy jar of pickled jalapenos. This is the easiest way to add some brightness and a little kick to your home cooking life. These pickled jalapenos are ready in under an hour, but <em>BEWARE</em> these take a day or two to mellow in the fridge, so they will be spicy right after being made! Yields 1 liter jar.</p>

    <p>Prep Time: 10 mins | Cook Time: 30 mins | Total Time: 45 mins</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>20 jalape√±os</strong>, sliced, stems discarded</li>
        <li><strong>2 cloves</strong> garlic, smashed and peeled</li>
        <li><strong>1.25 cup</strong> distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>1.25 cup</strong> filtered water</li>
        <li><strong>1.25 cup</strong> sugar, optional as this is for flavoring</li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sauce pan combine sugar, salt, garlic, water and vinegar.</li>
        <li>Heat to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Once at a boil; add the sliced jalapenos pressing them so they are submerged under the pickling liquids. Remove the pot off of the heat and let them sit for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use tongs to transfer the jalapenos into a clean jar. Ladle the pickling juices over top until you've reached the top of the jar. Let cool at room temperature before securing a lid and popping them into the fridge.</li>

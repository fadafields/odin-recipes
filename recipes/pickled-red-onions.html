    <h2>Sweet & Tangy Pickled Red Onions</h2>

    <p>Pickled red onions add a crispy, sweet, and tangy pop to sandwiches, burgers, tacos, salads, and so much more! These will last around 3 weeks in the fridge once you make them, but once you experience what these add to any number of dishes, you'll go through them in no time!</p>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>10 oz. Mason Jars</li>
        <li>Mandoline</li>
        <li>Medium Pot</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 small</strong> red onions</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> white vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> water</li>
        <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> cane sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Optional</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>2</strong> garlic cloves</li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> mixed peppercorns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice the onions (it's helpful to use a mandoline), and divide the onions between 2 (16-ounce) jars or 3 (10-ounce) jars. Place the garlic and peppercorns in each jar, if using</li>
        <li>Heat the vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 1 minute. Let cool and pour over the onions. Set aside to cool to room temperature, then store the onions in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Your pickled onions will be ready to eat once they're bright pink and tender - about 1 hour for very thinly sliced onions, or overnight for thicker sliced onions. They will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

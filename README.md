I'm curious to see how much I have retained since starting the html lessons. It's been a couple days since I've gotten into the lessons, so this will be good practice.

Reflection

This has been a great way to build up some muscle memory for the process of creating a basic website. I definitely need to stage and commit more frequently. I didn't fully understand the ability to use commit messages within vscode but now feel more confident in the process. It's going to take some practice writing succinct subject lines, nut I understand the general concept that I need to get accross.

Overall, I'm feeling energized by this project, can't wait to continue the journey!
